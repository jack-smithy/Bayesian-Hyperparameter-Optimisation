# heart-disease-prediction

Gradient Boosting Classifier to predict cases of heart disease. Implemented my own Baesian hyperparameter optimsation using gaussian processes. Possibly overkill for this simple model but easy to use in a more complex model. Currently working on plotting the function space to visualise the process.
